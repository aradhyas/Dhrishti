Our college major project that uses YOLO v3 for object detection and text to speech to speak out the name. All this wrapped in an Android project.


In some android versions we need to put some commands in AndroidManifest.xml:

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
